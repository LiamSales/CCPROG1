# CCPROG1
Logic Formulation and Introductory Programming

This is an updated version of the first ever project I had programmed
as it was required as the Machine Project for the course.

Restaurants and fast-food chains have been using ordering systems for handling orders. These kinds of
systems not only takes inputs of the orders but also computes the amount due for the order. This project
will have you develop such a system.
